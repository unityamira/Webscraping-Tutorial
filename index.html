<h1> Welcome to the BeautifulSoup Clue Murder Mystery </h1>

<h2> The Case</h2>

<P> 100 years ago on a dark and stormy night tragedy struck the xxperson estate, when, in the wee hours of the morning, during one 
    of Xpersons extravagant parties, the hostess was found dead. A team of detectives worked tirelessly for several 
    years to solve the case, taking (possibly too) detailed notes from over 100 interviews about the whereabouts and actions of 
    6 key suspects. However, the detectives reached a stalemate and the case was closed.

    ...until now

    due to recent advances in forensic technology, experts have been able to identify new facts in the case that they believe 
    could lead to its solving. Through detailed computer reconstruction, its has been determined that the muder took place in 
    the billiards room using a candlestick at around 1:05 in the morning. 
    
    However, the detective's original notes are ...verbose, and contain over XXobservations, not all of them relating to the key suspects. Your team has been brought on to analyze these documents
    to discover if the facts of the case reveal any suspect who was seen in this room, with this object, and was not seen leaving 
    the party before the murder took place.
