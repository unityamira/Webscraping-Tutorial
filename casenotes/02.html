            <h2>Furniture and Layout</h2>

            <div class="furniture">
                <h3>Central Island</h3>
                <p>The central island is a large marble countertop with intricate gray veining. It serves as both a prep area and a casual dining space, with several high-backed bar stools positioned around it. A large butcher’s block sits at one end of the island, with various kitchen knives and a cutting board. A set of red-stained napkins is scattered across the marble surface, and a spilled bowl of flour is smeared across one corner.</p>

            <div class="furniture">
                <h3>Cooking Range</h3>
                <p>Against one wall stands a professional-grade six-burner cooking range with a double oven below. The stove top is slightly greasy, with a few splatters of what appears to be oil or sauce. The oven door is closed, but a faint smell of burnt food emanates from it. Nearby, a large pot is left on the stove with a partially simmered sauce still cooking.</p>

            <div class="furniture">
                <h3>Refrigerator</h3>
                <p>A tall stainless steel refrigerator stands against another wall. The fridge is slightly ajar, revealing a disorganized interior with a few scattered food items. There is a noticeable smear of blood on the handle, suggesting it may have been touched by someone involved in the incident.</p>

            <div class="furniture">
                <h3>Dishwasher and Sink</h3>
                <p>The dishwasher is built into the cabinetry beneath the counter. The door is slightly open, and the interior is filled with dirty dishes. Next to it, the sink is filled with soapy water and a few used utensils, as well as a bloodied dishcloth that was used to clean up the crime scene.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="furniture">
                <h3>Pantry</h3>
                <p>The door to a small walk-in pantry is ajar, and inside, shelves are stocked with various non-perishable food items. A few bags of flour and sugar have been knocked over, adding to the scene of disorder. A large wooden spoon lies on the floor, coated with what looks like a mixture of flour and blood.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Ambiance and Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The kitchen’s usual atmosphere of warmth and homeliness is overshadowed by the violent crime scene. The bright, sterile lighting casts stark shadows on the surfaces, accentuating the mess and chaos of the scene. The clean white tiles now bear smudges and splashes of blood, which contrast sharply with their intended pristine condition.</p>
            <p>The scent of burnt food lingers in the air, mingling with the metallic odor of blood and the faint, sour smell of spilled flour. The normally inviting aroma of cooked meals is replaced by a sense of unease and tension.</p>
            <p>The quiet hum of the refrigerator and the occasional drip of water from the sink provide the only sounds, adding to the stillness and tension of the scene.</p>

            <h2>Detailed Observations</h2>
            <p>The kitchen’s layout reveals a scene of confusion and hurried action. The bloodstain on the floor and the disarray of kitchen items suggest a violent struggle took place.
