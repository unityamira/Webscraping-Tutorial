            <p>Tudor Mansion’s library is an expansive and opulent space, exuding an air of historical grandeur and old-world charm. The room is large enough to comfortably accommodate a small gathering, with high ceilings adorned with intricate wooden beams and an elaborate chandelier hanging from the center. The chandelier’s crystal pendants reflect the flickering light of the fireplace below, creating a soft, mesmerizing glow throughout the room.</p>

            <h2>Furniture and Layout</h2>

            <div class="item">
                <h3>Bookshelves</h3>
                <p>The walls are lined with towering, dark oak bookshelves that stretch from floor to ceiling. These shelves are filled with leather-bound volumes and antique books, their spines decorated with gold embossing. The books are meticulously arranged, with occasional gaps where volumes have been removed or misplaced. Several books have fallen to the floor, their pages splayed open, adding a sense of disarray to the otherwise orderly environment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h3>Grand Fireplace</h3>
                <p>On the far wall, a magnificent marble fireplace dominates the room. The mantle is adorned with an ornate brass clock, its face encased in a richly decorated frame. A series of family portraits and antique knick-knacks are carefully arranged on the mantle, providing a glimpse into the mansion’s storied past. The fire crackles gently, its warmth adding a comforting contrast to the grim scene. The hearth is surrounded by a polished brass fender and a set of elegant brass fire tools.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h3>Crimson Rug</h3>
                <p>At the center of the room, a sumptuous crimson rug lies atop the polished wooden floor. The rug’s intricate design features swirling patterns of gold and deep red, providing a rich contrast to the dark wood and the muted tones of the room. A large, ominous stain of blood forms a stark, unsettling contrast against the deep crimson fabric.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h3>Mahogany Desk</h3>
                <p>A large mahogany desk sits centrally on the rug, its surface cluttered with a variety of objects. Papers are strewn across the desk, some neatly stacked and others scattered in disarray. An ornate inkstand with a feather quill, a couple of antique brass letter openers, and an old leather-bound ledger are among the items present. The desk’s dark, polished surface is marred by the bloodstain from Mr. Boddy’s body.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h3>Leather Chairs</h3>
                <p>Surrounding the desk are several high-backed leather chairs with deep green upholstery. The leather is soft but worn from years of use, with a few creases and scratches evident on the surface. The chairs are arranged in a semi-circle around the desk, as if positioned for a serious discussion or meeting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h3>Desk Lamp</h3>
                <p>A large, brass desk lamp stands on one side of the desk. Its glass shade is adorned with delicate floral patterns and is positioned at an angle, casting a pool of warm light over the desk’s surface. The lamp has been knocked over during the struggle, and the broken glass lies scattered on the rug around it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h3>Wooden Side Table</h3>
                <p>Near the desk, a small wooden side table holds a crystal decanter filled with dark brown liquor and a single glass. A few drops of the liquor have spilled onto the table and the floor, adding to the disorder of the scene.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h3>Large Bay Window</h3>
                <p>On one side of the room, a large bay window offers a view of the mansion’s gardens. The window is framed with heavy, dark red velvet drapes, which are currently drawn back to let in the evening light. The glass panes are spotless, reflecting the softly glowing lights from the chandelier and the fire.</p>

        <section class="ambiance">
            <h2>Ambiance and Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The ambiance of the library is one of quiet opulence disrupted by sudden tragedy. The room’s rich, deep colors—burgundy, gold, and dark green—contrast sharply with the vivid, unsettling red of the bloodstain. The warm light from the fireplace and the chandelier creates a cozy, almost inviting atmosphere that clashes starkly with the horror of the scene.</p>
            <p>The soft crackling of the fire provides a background soundtrack to the somber setting, occasionally interrupted by the hushed murmurs of the suspects and the shuffling of feet on the wooden floor. The scent of old books, polished wood, and a faint hint of burning logs mingle in the air, masking the metallic tang of blood.</p>
            <p>The stillness of the room is punctuated by the occasional creak of the floorboards or the rustle of pages as the investigators move about. Despite the luxurious furnishings and elegant decor, there is an undeniable tension in the air, as if the room itself is holding its breath, waiting for the mystery to be solved.</p>

            <h2>Additional Details</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A broken picture frame</strong> lies on the floor near the desk, the glass shattered but the photograph inside—an old family portrait—intact. It’s slightly askew, adding to the sense of disturbance in the room.</li>
                <li><strong>A half-open drawer</strong> on the desk reveals an assortment of documents, including a few old letters and a worn, leather-bound notebook. The drawer’s disarray hints at a hurried search or a struggle.</li>
                <li><strong>A faint draft</strong> can be felt near the window, where the heavy velvet drapes are drawn back. The draft causes the pages of the open books to flutter slightly, as though the room itself is whispering secrets.</li>
                <li><strong>Footprints in the blood</strong> near the desk hint at the movement of the body and the struggle that occurred. The prints are mostly obscured by the bloodstain, but they suggest hurried steps.</li>
                <li><strong>The shadows</strong> cast by the chandelier and the fire create eerie shapes on the walls, contributing to the room’s unsettling ambiance.</li>
